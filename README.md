# Scripts
Unix scripts:

1.  networkAlive.sh: asks for a network address and gives you the IP addresses of all the devices alive on that network.
2.  autoNetworkAlive.sh : detects your network IP address and gives you the IP addresses of all the hosts present on your network.
3.  autoPortScanner.sh : asks for an IP address and ports to scan for and checks if that port is Open (listening).

Run the script as : ./script_name.sh
